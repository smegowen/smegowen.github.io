<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
I am 32 years old.
Originally from Massachusetts.
Lived in California for 12 years.
Professional background in health and fitness (as a personal trainer and sports performance coach) and sports coaching (mostly tennis).
I have also worked in renewable energy at a residential solar company and in consumer packaged goods at a drink startup in the cannabis industry.
I recently moved to Hawaii where I will continue to coach tennis and work in the health and fitness industry.
I am also interested in sustainable agriculture and land use economics.
In my free time I enjoy hiking, trail running, swimming, surfing, paddling, diving, and spear fishing.
I am learning full stack web development so that I can design and build websites related to my work and my interests.
